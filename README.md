Pokemon Flutter App is a beautiful and highly functional Pokemon application built with Flutter 3.0 and powered by the GetX pattern for state management. This app allows you to view a list of Pokemon with smooth animations, see Pokemon details with great transitions, and view custom error pages.

## Features

### 1. List Pokemon with smooth animation

This feature allows you to scroll through a list of Pokemon. Each Pokemon is displayed in a card that smoothly animates into view.

### 2. Detail Pokemon with amazing transition

When you select a Pokemon from the list, the app transitions to a detailed view of the selected Pokemon. The transition is seamless and enhances the user experience.

### 3. Error page

In the event of a problem (such as a loss of internet connection), the app shows a custom error page. This page provides a more personalized and user-friendly error handling.
