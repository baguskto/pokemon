Pokemon Flutter App is a beautiful and highly functional Pokemon application built with Flutter and powered by the GetX pattern for state management. This app allows you to view a list of Pokemon with smooth animations, see Pokemon details with great transitions, and view custom error pages.

## Features

### 1. List Pokemon with smooth animation

This feature allows you to scroll through a list of Pokemon. Each Pokemon is displayed in a card that smoothly animates into view.
